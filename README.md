<h1>ðŸ’¡Mr Judge - Product Spec</h1>
ðŸ¤” <b>A coding challenge is a competitive event in which a group of participants solve a set of coding questions within a specified timeframe, typically ranging from a few hours to a few days. Participants who have registered beforehand compete by submitting their solutions, which are
evaluated against concealed test cases. Based on the test results, participants are assigned scores.</b>

<h1>ðŸ‘€ Areas of concern</h1>
<li>Scalabiliity</li>
<li>Malicious code execution</li>
<li>Network congestion</li>
